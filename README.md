# Customer_Lifetime_Value_Analysis
## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis is a method used to estimate the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer account throughout the entirety of their relationship with the company.
  Step 1: First, load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure, especially focusing on columns relevant to CLV analysis such as Customer ID, Acquisition Date, Acquisition Cost, Purchase Date, Transaction Amount, and any other related metrics. Ensure the data is clean, with consistent and accurate formatting across all relevant columns.

  Step 2: Design a schema based on your dataset’s structure. For CLV analysis, you’ll need tables that capture customer acquisition details as well as transaction or purchase details. Import your datasets into the respective tables in your SQL database. Sometimes, you have separate tables for customer acquisition and transaction details that need to be linked via Customer ID.

  Step 3: Calculate foundational metrics necessary for CLV analysis, such as:

    Total Revenue per Customer: The sum of all transaction amounts per customer.
    Purchase Frequency: The number of purchases per customer over a specific period.
    Average Purchase Value: The average transaction amount per purchase for each customer.
